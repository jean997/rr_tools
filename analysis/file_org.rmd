## Introduction


The first step of trying to reproduce an analysis is figuring out where the old analysis is and how you did it. Towards this end it is good to have some overarching organizational structure for your digital content. This is a personal matter that everyone will sort out for themselves but you should give it some thought. 


Here is one structure I have found useful for project directories:

```
YYYY_project_name:
    data_analysis:
        YYYY-MM-DD_analysis_name1:
        YYYY-MM-DD_analysis_name2:
    simulations:
        YYYY-MM-DD_simulations_name1:
        YYYY-MM-DD_analysis_name2:
    R_package_directory:
    reports:
    data:
```

+ If you pre-pend directory and file names with the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format they will automatically be ordered chronologically which in some cases is exactly what you want.
+ Putting dates in file/directory names will also make it easy to find what you are looking for later. 
+ If some of your project material lives in other places in your filesystem you can create symbolic links in your main project directory. In linux you can create symbolic links using `ln -s`. Read more [here]().
